It is a basic SingIn-Blog application which is connected to a local-storage. As the todo app., I have already built this application a couple of months before. The previous version was not equiped with local-storage, in addition, I have tried to use libraries for styling, such as materializeCss & reactstrap. Unlike the previous versions, with this one, one can keep datas for longer period of time as he/her wished and with delete button, the user can get rid of nolonger wanted elements from the list. On this one as well, I need to add some styling and additional features to make it more performing and multifunctional.
